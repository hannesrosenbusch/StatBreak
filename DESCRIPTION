Title: Examine robustness of sample statistics to case deletions

Author: Hannes Rosenbusch

Description: Through this package, researchers can conduct easy and insightful robustness tests.
    Generally, the provided function 'study_break' answers the question: How few and which cases would need to be deleted
    for a substantial change in the sample statistic?
    The underlying algorithm searches the space of possible subsamples through genetic evolution.
    Most code for implementing the generic genetic algorithm code was copied and modified from the
    general purpose package 'genalg' by Egon Willighagen and Michel Ballings (currently not maintained).
